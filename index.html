        <h1>Nanotechnology Engineering</h1>
        <div class="content">Nanotechnology enables all technology. Some of today's most innovative scientific and
            engineering breakthroughs are happening at scales smaller than we ever thought possible. As the root of
            innovation, fueling changes in life and society, nanotechnology opens many career options from medical to
            pharmaceuticals to electronics to automotive and materials research.

            In Canada's first accredited undergraduate Nanotechnology Engineering program, you'll use principles from
            biology, chemistry, electronics, and quantum physics to create materials and machines far too small to see
            with the naked eye.

            You'll gain extensive experience in your lab courses and through a range of paid co-op opportunities. In
            your upper years, you'll spend eight months at a time on co-op work terms, so you can really dig deep into a
            project — and graduate with a seriously impressive résumé.

            Nanoscience and nanotechnology involve the ability to see and to control individual atoms and molecules.
            Everything on Earth is made up of atoms—the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the buildings and houses we
            live in, and our own bodies.

            But something as small as an atom is impossible to see with the naked eye. In fact, it’s impossible to see
            with the microscopes typically used in a high school science classes. The microscopes needed to see things
            at the nanoscale were invented in the early 1980s.

            Once scientists had the right tools, such as the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the atomic force
            microscope (AFM), the age of nanotechnology was born.

            Although modern nanoscience and nanotechnology are quite new, nanoscale materials were used for centuries.
            Alternate-sized gold and silver particles created colors in the stained glass windows of medieval churches
            hundreds of years ago. The artists back then just didn't know that the process they used to create these
            beautiful works of art actually led to changes in the composition of the materials they were working with.

            Today's scientists and engineers are finding a wide variety of ways to deliberately make materials at the
            nanoscale to take advantage of their enhanced properties such as higher strength, lighter weight, increased
            control of light spectrum, and greater chemical reactivity than their larger-scale counterparts.<br>
